    "\n",
    "To understand one of the most important concepts in machine learning evaluation, the bias-variance tradeoff, we must first establish what each term means. Simply put, *bias* is the tendency of to systematically over or under-estimate something. For example, if a seesaw has starts off at an incline, then we can say that it is already biased to one side regardless of the weight of the people using it. On the other hand, *variance* measures how far some metric is from a mean value. High variance corresponds to more spread out observations while low variance corresponds to datapoints that're clumped closer together. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do these terms work in machine learning models? One way to think about a model that is highly biased is to consider the worst case- where the model fails to learn anything at all. Then, the model is held to its pre-training parameters, and thus biased towards these results. In the case of variance, the opposite is true. Consider a model whose parameters yield a fairly accurate average result. If it exhibits high variance, then its predictions will vary more from that average result, meaning it is more sensitive to any noise in the data. "
