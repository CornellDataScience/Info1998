    "Actually, there are four major categories of machine learning systems: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Semisupervised learning, as you can guess, involved models that take in __partially labeled data__ (usually a lot of unlabeled data and just a little labeled data), while reinforcement learning covers goal-oriented algorithms that repeatedly learn and master a particular (usuallly complex task). Reinforcement learning is often the basis of many \"AI learns to play...\" youtube and facebook videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Side note, you can watch people use reinforcement learning to beat games_ [_here_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4KBBAwF_bE) _(super cool) and_ [_here_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MasxAN-xZIU) _(a less successful - but no less cool - attempt)_\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an overview of these different categories, we highly recommend you read the very first chapter of this book: [__Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow__](http://index-of.es/Varios-2/Hands%20on%20Machine%20Learning%20with%20Scikit%20Learn%20and%20Tensorflow.pdf) (and continue reading if you want to learn how to implement them in Python). In fact, if you go through the book, some of the concepts should seem familiar to you, as we covered them either briefly or somewhat in depth throughout the semester. Indeed, be proud of yourself: you already have the basic concepts of machine learning and data science more or less nailed down!"
