### Catalog description

1 credit.  S/U Only. The goal of this course is to provide you with a high-level exposure to a wide range of Data Science techniques and Machine Learning models, for the purpose of enabling you to solve real problems with machine learning. The course covers getting set up, manipulating and visualizing large datasets, building supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, and a discussion about the various application of these methods in the real world. If you have religiously followed the course throughout the semester, you should expect to have a high-level and intuitive understanding of how data problems could be tackled. You can apply this quick implementation-oriented toolkit you develop yourself to a variety of fields and problems.

If you are interested in a solid mathematical foundation for data science and machine learning, this class is not sufficient in itself. This course, however, should serve as a head start for you. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Prerequisites

No prerequisites; Basic Python experience (at the level of **CS 1110**) is encouraged.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Course technologies

- We will be working together on in-class assignments/exercises during lectures, so please
bring a laptop (or tablet) to fully participate.
- You will need a conda environment and/or virtualenv setup with necessary Python libraries.
- Please refer to the [Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting_started.md %})
page for more information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Class material

Class material will be posted on our course website, including the assignments, lecture
slides, notes, and demos.

We will use CMS for assignment / project submissions and feedbacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Course work

#### Weekly assignments
There will be one in-class assignment per lecture, **10 total** throughout the semester. All assignments will be done individually. The assignment will be released at the beginning of the lecture (5:30pm ET on Wednesday), and will be due **5:30pm ET next Wednesday** (before the start of the following lecture). Each assignment is of reasonable length that we will be able to cover it in lecture (with one additional homework question), but never force yourself to finish it quickly, and donâ€™t let it disturb you from lecture!

#### Feedback and Grade Postings

We will be providing you with feedback on the Cornell University Course Management System
([CMS](https://cmsx.cs.cornell.edu/)). We will grade your work as soon as reasonably possible,
latest by Sunday midnight.

#### Grading

This is a 1-credit S/U class. In order to get a Satisfactory (S) grade, you will need at least 70%.

There are three components to grading:
- **Weekly Assignments (50%)**: As described above. You may skip up to **one assignment**.
- **Mid-Semester Group Project (15%)**: There will be a mid-semester project around mid-October. More guidelines will be released on Piazza.
- **Final Group Project (35%)**: There will be an open-ended final project near the end of the semester as part of
CDS Hackathon. You will need to choose your own competition / research topic and form a group to work together. Project will be graded based on completion with sufficient amount of effort, and the top teams will receive prize.

This is a student-run course, so we understand how stressful classes can get. Above all, we want you to enjoy learning and applying the course content. So if you are concerned about passing this class, or have any reasonable cases to make for deadline extensions, please reach out the course manager or post a private note on Piazza immediately. We would love to see you succeed, but can only help if you notify us in time.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Course policies

#### Attendance

Attendance is required. We discuss the answers to the assigned assignments in class, and coming to lectures ensures at least a fairly high score on assignments.

#### Academic Integrity

All Cornell students are expected to follow the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity
([http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm](http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm)). Do not refer to notes from previous semesters or data science projects available online. Our instructors have caught these in the past and the penalty for plagiarism is an unsatisfactory (U) grade.
